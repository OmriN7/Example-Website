# Omrii's Example-Website
Hello! This is some of my sample code for an example website.

*gh-pages branch* - distribution

*master branch* - source

There still are a few things that I want to add and a few bugs that need to be fixed, so don't consider this as the final product. 

Here's the list of all of those things:

- Top page anchor buttons seems to fade in and out kind of akwardly.
- Ensure that only concatnated compiled files are in dist.
- Add a footer
- Switch to using awesomefont in the press-kit page
- Fix the padding on the 'About Us' paragraph areas
- Ensure every page works in xs (less than 768px) views.
- Add mobile support !

Any feedback is helpful!
