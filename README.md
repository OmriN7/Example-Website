# Omrii's Example-Website
Hello! This is some of my sample code for an example website.

Here are some things I need to do: 

- Create dist and src branch
- Move all of the js files into one main js file.

// After all the crap above is finihsed move on to doing these things:
- Ensure that everything works well on my iPhone :)

- The header on mobile's weird
- Make sure that the parralax script doesn't run on mobile
