# Omrii's Example-Website
Hello! This is some of my sample code for an example website.

gh-pages branch - distribution

master branch - source

There still are a few things that I want to add and a few fixes that need to be done, so here's a list of all of those things:

- Ensure that only concatnated compiled files are in dist.
- Add a footer
- Switch to using awesomefont in the press-kit page
- Fix the padding on the 'About Us' paragraph areas
- Ensure every page works in xs (less than 768px) views.
- Add mobile support !
